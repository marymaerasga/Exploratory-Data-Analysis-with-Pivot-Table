This project is inspired by my self-study journey into Microsoft Excel and data analytics. I participated in free training videos provided by DataSense Analytics, focusing on the Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel Associate (MO-200). This training provided a comprehensive understanding of Excel features and functionality.

I also watched a dedicated video on Data Analysis with Pivot Tables, which helped me understand the following:
- **What are Pivot Tables?**
